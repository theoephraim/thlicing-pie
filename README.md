# Slice of DAO

### A Slice of DAO is a universal, one-size-fits all model that creates a perfectly fair equity split in an early-stage, bootstrapped start-up company.

Calculating everyone's fair share of the equity in a startup can be complicated. A Slice of DAO makes this automatic, fair and easy to use.

Based on the [Slicing Pie](https://slicingpie.com/) formula, Slicing the DAO keeps track and calculates each shareholders % share of the equity based on their at-risk contributions. 

At-risk contributions include time and money contributions to your company.

New shareholders can join a company either by being issued new shares/slices of the organisation or if they buy some available shares of the company.

Company shareholders can make new proposals to mint new tokens to a certain individual (to reimburse them for expenses outside of the blockchain such as for hours of work contributed to the organisation), they can make proposals to spend company assets and finally they can make proposals to pay out dividends to a shareholder.

Shareholders then either vote 'yes' or 'no' on each proposal, the proportion of each shareholder's vote is the same as the proportion of their share of the company pie. Once the share of the votes has reached 70% in either yeses or nos the proposal is accepted or rejected.

Slice of DAO leverages 0x-Instant to enable current shareholders to sell their shares and thereby allowing new investors to become part of the organisation.
